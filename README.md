# YOLO-Object-Detection-Voice
ðŸ“¸ Voice-Enabled Smart Vision Backend Description This is designed to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users. Built with FastAPI and integrated with a modular camera pipeline, it captures live frames, analyzes objects using deep learning, and narrates results using pyttsx3.

ðŸ”§ Features
- Real-Time Object Detection
Seamless camera-to-backend pipeline optimized for mobile and desktop environments.
- Voice Narration Engine
Converts object labels into spoken feedback using a threaded TTS system.
- Modular Architecture
Clean separation of capture, analysis, and narration layers for rapid iteration and scalability.
- Accessibility-First Design
Prioritizes low-latency feedback and compatibility with assistive technologies.
